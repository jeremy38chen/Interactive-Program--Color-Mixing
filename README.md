# Interactive-Program--Color-Mixing

#Introduction

  The purpose of this project is to create a shiny light which is controlled by a pad made of three photoresistor. The sparkling light I product is similar to the bulb which used to decorate at festival. However, the project I made can change in various way which is all depending on ourself. This is the most difference from the normal bulb. 

#How to do it
  In this project, Iâ€˜m going to use the LED with 4 legs. The LED has red, green, blue and a common ground. We are using photoresists to control the number of the elements which helps LED to product diversity of color.
  There is a important point in this project. Analog input can be recognized at the range 0 to 1023. Nevertheless, analog output yields at the
range 0 to 255 which is different from the
input.
Therefore, we have to divide the analog output by 4.
